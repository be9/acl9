# acl9

[![Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/be9/acl9.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/be9/acl9) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/be9/acl9/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/be9/acl9) [![Test Coverage](https://codeclimate.com/github/be9/acl9/badges/coverage.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/be9/acl9)

Acl9 is a role-based authorization system that provides a concise DSL for
securing your Rails application.

Access control is pointless if you're not sure you've done it right.  The
fundamental goal of acl9 is to ensure that your rules are easy to understand and
easy to test - in other words acl9 makes it easy to ensure you've got your
permissions correct.

## Installation

Acl9 is [Semantically Versioned](http://semver.org/), so just add this to your
`Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'acl9', '~> 1.0'
```

We dropped support for Rails < 4 in the 1.x releases, so if you're still using
Rails 2.x or 3.x then you'll want this:

```ruby
gem 'acl9', '~> 0.12'
```

## Getting Started

The simplest way to demonstrate this is with some examples.

### Access Control

You declare the access control directly in your controller, so it's visible and
obvious for any developer looking at the controller:

```ruby
class Admin::SchoolsController < ApplicationController
  access_control do
    allow :support, School
    allow :admins, :managers, :teachers, :of => :school
    deny :teachers, :to => :destroy

    action :index do
      allow anonymous, logged_in
    end

    allow logged_in, :to => :show
    deny :students
  end

  def index
    # ...
  end

  # ...
end
```

You can see more about all this stuff in the wiki under [Access Control
Subsystem](//github.com/be9/acl9/wiki/Access-Control-Subsystem)

### Roles

The other side of acl9 is where you give and remove roles to and from a user. As
you're looking through these examples refer back to the [Access
Control](#access-control) example and you should be able to see which access
control rule each role corresponds to.

Let's say we want to create an admin of a given school, not a global admin, just
the admin for a particular school:

```ruby
user.has_role! :admin, school
```

Then let's say we have some support people in our organization who are dedicated
to supporting all the schools. We could do two things, either we could come up
with a new role name like `:school_support` or we can use the fact that we can
assign roles to any object, including a class, and do this:

```ruby
user.has_role! :support, School
```

You can see the `allow` line in our `access_control` block that this corresponds
with. If we had used `:school_support` instead then that line would have to be:
`allow :school_support`

Now, when a support person leaves that team, we need to remove that role:

```ruby
user.has_no_role! :support, School
```

Subsystem](//github.com/be9/acl9/wiki/Role-Subsystem)

## Upgrade Notes

Please, PLEASE, **PLEASE** note. If you're upgrading from the `0.x` series of acl9
then there's an important change in one of the defaults for `1.x`. We flipped
the default value of `:protect_global_roles` from `false` to `true`.

Say you had a role on an object:

```ruby
user.has_role! :manager, department
```

We all know that this means:

```ruby
user.has_role? :manager, department    # => true
```

With `:protect_global_roles` set to `false`, as it was in `0.x` then the above
role would mean that the global `:manager` role would also be `true`.

Ie. this is how `0.x` behaved:

```ruby
user.has_role? :manager      # => true
```

Now in `1.x` we default `:protect_global_roles` to `true` which means that the
global `:manager` role is protected, ie:

```ruby
user.has_role? :manager      # => false
```

In words, in 1.x just because you're the `:manager` of a `department` that
doesn't make you a global `:manager` (anymore).
