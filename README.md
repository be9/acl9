Acl9 is a role-based authorization system that provides a concise DSL for
securing your Rails application.

Access control is pointless if you're not sure you've done it right.  The
fundamental goal of acl9 is to ensure that your rules are easy to understand and
easy to test - in other words acl9 makes it easy to ensure you've got your
permissions correct.

## Installation

Acl9 is [Semantically Versioned](http://semver.org/), so just add this to your
`Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'acl9', '~> 2.0'
```

You will need Ruby 2.x

We dropped support for Rails < 4 in the 1.x releases, so if you're still using
Rails 2.x or 3.x then you'll want this:

```ruby
gem 'acl9', '~> 0.12'
```

## Getting Started

The simplest way to demonstrate this is with some examples.

### Access Control

You declare the access control directly in your controller, so it's visible and
obvious for any developer looking at the controller:

```ruby
class Admin::SchoolsController < ApplicationController
  access_control do
    allow :support, :of => School
    allow :admins, :managers, :teachers, :of => :school
    deny :teachers, :only => :destroy

    action :index do
      allow anonymous, logged_in
    end

    allow logged_in, :only => :show
    deny :students
  end

  def index
    # ...
  end

  # ...
end
```

You can see more about all this stuff in the wiki under [Access Control
Subsystem](//github.com/be9/acl9/wiki/Access-Control-Subsystem)

### Roles

The other side of acl9 is where you give and remove roles to and from a user. As
you're looking through these examples refer back to the [Access
Control](#access-control) example and you should be able to see which access
control rule each role corresponds to.

Let's say we want to create an admin of a given school, not a global admin, just
the admin for a particular school:

```ruby
user.has_role! :admin, school
user.has_role! :admin, of: school
```

Then let's say we have some support people in our organization who are dedicated
to supporting all the schools. We could do two things, either we could come up
with a new role name like `:school_support` or we can use the fact that we can
assign roles to any object, including a class, and do this:

```ruby
user.has_role! :support, School
user.has_role! :support, for: School
```

You can see the `allow` line in our `access_control` block that this corresponds
with. If we had used `:school_support` instead then that line would have to be:
`allow :school_support`

Now, when a support person leaves that team, we need to remove that role:

```ruby
user.has_no_role! :support, School
user.has_no_role! :support, at: School
```

You can see more about all this stuff in the wiki under [Role
Subsystem](//github.com/be9/acl9/wiki/Role-Subsystem)

## Database Setup

As mentioned in [Role Subsystem](//github.com/be9/acl9/wiki/Role-Subsystem) you
don't have to use these, if your role system is very simple all you need is a
`has_role?` method in your subject model that returns a boolean and the Access
Control part of Acl9 will work from that.

However, most commonly, the roles and role assignments are stored in two new
tables that you create specifically for Acl9. There's a rails generator for
creating the migrations, role model and updating the subject model and
optionally any number of object models.

You can view the USAGE for this generator by running the following in your app
directory:

```sh
bin/rails g acl9:setup -h
```

## Configuration

There are five configurable settings. These all have sensible defaults which can
be easily overridden in `config/initializers/acl9.rb`

You can also override each of the `:default_*` settings (dropping the "default_"
prefix) in your models/controllers - see below for more detail:

### :default_role_class_name

Set to `'Role'` and can be overridden in your "user" model, [see the wiki for more](//github.com/be9/acl9/wiki/Role-Subsystem#custom-class-names).
 
### :default_association_name

Set to `:role_objects` and can be overridden in
your "user" model, [see the wiki for more](//github.com/be9/acl9/wiki/Role-Subsystem#subject-model).
We chose a name for this association that was unlikely to conflict with
existing models but a lot of people override this to be just `:roles`

### :default_subject_class_name

Set to `'User'` and can be overridden in your
"role" model, [see the wiki for more](//github.com/be9/acl9/wiki/Role-Subsystem#custom-class-names).

### :default_subject_method

Set to `:current_user` and can be overridden in
your controllers, [see the wiki for more](//github.com/be9/acl9/wiki/Access-Control-Subsystem#subject_method).

### :default_join_table_name

This is set to `nil` by default, which will mean it will use the Rails method of
calculating the join table name for a `has_and_belongs_to_many` (eg.
`users_roles`). Remember that if you override this value, either do it before
you run `rails g acl9:setup` or be sure to update your migration or database.

### :normalize_role_names

Set to `true` (see "Upgrade Notes" below if you're upgrading) and can only be
changed by setting it in `Acl9.config`. When true this causes Acl9 to normalize
your role names, normalization is `.to_s.underscore.singularize`. This is done
on both the setter and getter.

### :protect_global_roles

Set to `true` (see "Upgrade Notes" below if you're upgrading) and can only be
changed by merging into `Acl9.config`.  This setting changes how global roles
(ie. roles with no object) are treated.

Say we set a role like so:

```ruby
user.has_role! :admin, school
```

When `:protect_global_roles` is `true` (as is the default) then `user.has_role?
:admin` is `false`. Ie. changing the role on a specific instance doesn't impact
the global role (hence the name).

When `:protect_global_roles` is `false` then `user.has_role? :admin` is `true`.
Ie. setting a role on a specific instance makes that person a global one of
those roles.

Basically these are just two different ways of working with roles, if you're
protecting your global roles then you can use them as sort of a superuser
version of a given role. So you can have an admin of a school **and** a global
admin with different privileges.

If you don't protect your global roles then you can use them as a catch-all for
any specific roles, so then the admins of schools, classrooms and students can
all be granted a privilege by allowing the global `:admin` role.

### Example

```ruby
# config/initializers/acl9.rb
Acl9.config.default_association_name = :roles

# or...
Acl9.configure do |c|
  c.default_association_name = :roles
end
```

### Reset Defaults

On the off chance that you ever need to reset the config back to its default you
can use:

```ruby
Acl9.config.reset!
```

## Upgrade Notes

### Acl9 now protects global roles by default

Please, PLEASE, **PLEASE** note. If you're upgrading from the `0.x` series of acl9
then there's an important change in one of the defaults for `1.x`. We flipped
the default value of `:protect_global_roles` from `false` to `true`.

Say you had a role on an object:

```ruby
user.has_role! :manager, department
```

We all know that this means:

```ruby
user.has_role? :manager, department    # => true
user.has_role? :manager, in: department    # => true
```

With `:protect_global_roles` set to `false`, as it was in `0.x` then the above
role would mean that the global `:manager` role would also be `true`.

Ie. this is how `0.x` behaved:

```ruby
user.has_role? :manager      # => true
```

Now in `1.x` we default `:protect_global_roles` to `true` which means that the
global `:manager` role is protected, ie:

```ruby
user.has_role? :manager      # => false
```

In words, in 1.x just because you're the `:manager` of a `department` that
doesn't make you a global `:manager` (anymore).

### Acl9 now normalizes role names by default

So basically we downcase, underscore, and singularize your role names, so:

```ruby
user.has_role! 'FooBars'

user.has_role? 'FooBars'     # => true
user.has_role? :foo_bar      # => true

user.has_role! :foo_bar      # => nil, because it was already set above
```

If you're upgrading then you will want to do something like this:

```ruby
Role.all.each do |role|
  role.update! name: role.name.underscore.singularize
end
```

**Then check for any duplicates** and resolve those manually.

### Acl9 now raises ArgumentError on bad args to `allow`/`deny`

In 2.x and above we now try to help the developer by raising ArgumentError if
they mess up with the options they pass to `allow`/`deny`, this prevents people
doing things that they think are going to work but actually aren't like:

```ruby
  allow all, actions: [ :index, :show ]    # <---- BROKEN!!
```
